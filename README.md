## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# :postbox: About Me
My name is Raj Bapat, I am a student and researcher at UCSD passionate about AI, Systems and Databases!

```cpp
class RajBapat
{
private:
    short int age = 20;
public:
    long long int yearsOfCompetitiveProgrammingInCPP = 8;
    std::string collegeName = "UCSD";
    double collegeGPA = 4.0;

    std::vector<std::string> experiences =
        { "SWE Intern at TikTok", "NSF Undergraduate Researcher at UC Davis", "Research Intern at Stanford University" }
    std::vector<std::string> traits =
        { "AI/ML", "Data", "Information Retrieval", "Systems", "SIMD" };
    std::vector<std::string> hobbies =
        { "Community Organizer", "Competitive Programming", "US Squash"};
};
```

I got hooked on programming when I was 12 years old, in just a few weeks, C++ felt like my second language. I got to the top 20 in my grade nationally in USA Computing Olympiad and even surprised myself having placed 6th in the nation in Virginia Tech High School Programming Contest! I have been in competitive programming contests for the last 8 years, this year as team captain and coach for my college's ICPC team.

My passion for algorithms skyrocked after my happenchance **_conversation with the Professor Donald Knuth_** (at a Diwali party!) and has now morphed into delving (and going beyond) the depths of more CS/Math/EE fields from AI/ML & Data Mining to SIMD/AVX intrinsics-based acceleration for Molecular Computing.
