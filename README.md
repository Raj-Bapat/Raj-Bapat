## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# :postbox: About Me
My name is Raj Bapat, I am a student and researcher at UCSD passionate about AI, Systems and Databases!

```cpp
class Raj-Bapat
{
private:
    int age = 20;
public:
    std::vector<std::string> traits = { "AI/ML", "Data", "Information Retrieval", "Systems", "SIMD" };
    std::vector<std::string> hobbies = { "Community Organizer", "Competitive Programming", "US Squash"};
};
```

I got hooked on programming when I was 12 years old, when I jumped into USA Computing Olympiad and competed nationally, reaching 6th Nationally in Virginia Tech High School Programming Contest! I have been pursuing it for the last 8 years, this year as the Team Captain for my College's ICPC team!

My passion for math and computer science has now morphed into a desire to go deep into a number of fields from AI/ML and Data Mining to hardware acceleration using SIMD/AVX intrinsics to Molecular Computing. 

# :round_pushpin: What Am I Doing?
- :clipboard: Currently I am:
  - Currently working as a SWE intern on building Machine Learning systems for content moderation at TikTok.
  - For the past year I have been working as an NSF-funded researcher in the Molecular Computing lab at UC Davis
  - I have also been researching Unsupervised Learning techniques like Clustering and Approximate Nearest Neighbour search, as they are a fundamental building block in the future of AI/ML, particularly Large Language Models.
