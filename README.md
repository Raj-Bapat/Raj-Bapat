## Hi there üëã

# :postbox: About Me
My name is Raj Bapat, and I am a student and researcher at UCSD interested in AI, Systems and Databases!

```cpp
class RajBapat
{
private:
    short int age = 20;
public:
    long long int yearsOfCompetitiveProgrammingInCPP = 8;
    std::string collegeName = "UCSD";
    double collegeGPA = 4.0;

    std::vector<std::string> experiences =
        { "SWE Intern at TikTok", "NSF Undergraduate Researcher at UC Davis", "Research Intern at Stanford University" }
    std::vector<std::string> traits =
        { "AI/ML", "Data", "Information Retrieval", "Systems", "SIMD" };
    std::vector<std::string> hobbies =
        { "Community Organizer", "Competitive Programming", "US Squash"};
};
```

I've been passionate about programming ever since I was 12 years old, when in just a few short weeks I coded Conway's _Game of Life_ from scratch in C++. I've been riding that wave ever since, eventually reaching the top-20 in my grade nationally in USA Computing Olympiad and placing 6th nationally at the Virginia Tech High School Programming Contest! I've been competing in programming contests for the last 8 years including this year as an ICPC team captain and coach.

My interest in algorithms was elevated by a chance conversation I had with the legend himself **Professor Donald Knuth** (at a Diwali party!), blossoming into multiple research projects across computing from AI/ML & Data Mining to SIMD/AVX intrinsics-based acceleration for Molecular Computing. 

# :round_pushpin: What Am I Doing?
- :clipboard: Currently, I am working as:
  - a **SWE Intern at TikTok Inc. building Machine Learning systems** at scale for content moderation (my ML experimentation platform is now running on TikTok prod :clap::clap:)
- :clipboard: Previously, I was working as:
  - an NSF Undergraduate Researcher in the Molecular Computing Lab at UC Davis
  - a researcher in AI/ML, Approx. Nearest Neightbour Search in SQL Databases
  - a Research Intern in OVAL Virtual Assistant Lab at Stanford University
  - an SWE Intern in Nutanix
 
# :star: What code can you use?
:clipboard: Here is some code that you may find useful for your own projects:
- C++ implementation library for [16 advanced algorithms](https://github.com/Raj-Bapat/competitive-programming-algorithm-implementations) for Competitive Programming
- Real-time [sentiment classification using Google Cloud](https://github.com/Raj-Bapat/AI-Augmented-Mind) in my research on AI Augmented Mind 
- Hardware-accelerated and Portable reference [SIMD implementation of Smith Waterman](https://github.com/Raj-Bapat/SIMD-Smith-Waterman) DNA matching algorithm and tests with SIMD implementation in Google/Highway to be portable across ARM, Intel and other platforms.
- A PostgreSQL [vector search RDBMS benchmark for performance and recall](https://github.com/Raj-Bapat/Analysis-and-Benchmark-for-Approx-Nearest-Neighbour-Search-in-SQL) analysis of SQL queries with Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search
- Hardware-accelerated [SIMD/AVX integrated into Nucliec Acid Designer](https://github.com/Raj-Bapat/SIMD-accelerated-Nucliec-Acid-Designer) open source tool

# :sunglasses: Take a glimpse at my research
I love exploring fields that push the boundaries of our understanding and accelerate future research. Recently, I‚Äôve been thinking about how to speed up bioinformatics algorithms with hardware acceleration, and diving deep into the world of Databases, AI and Information Retrieval.

# :people_holding_hands: Join my California communities
My most personally fulfilling projects involve building communities through programming competitions and programming clubs. I co-founded two annual regional competitions in two communities (SF Bay Area and Davis). I'm proud that both competitions continue to be cornerstones of thier respective regional programming communities, engaging 1000s of students yearly.
- Co-founded the [first Davis community competitive programming contest](https://acpc-ucd.com/) in 2023 sponsored by UC Davis CS Department faculty under the guidance of Slobodan Mitrovi ÃÅc, Assistant Professor in CS - contest now in its 2nd year
- Co-founded the [first SF Bay Area community programming contest](https://bapc.gunncpc.com/archive) in 2021. I created this as a joint contest between two bay area high schools (Paly & Gunn) to engage students during the pandemic - contest now in its 4th year
