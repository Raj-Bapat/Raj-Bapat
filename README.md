## Hi there üëã

# :postbox: About Me
My name is Raj Bapat, I am a student and researcher at UCSD passionate about AI, Systems and Databases!

```cpp
class RajBapat
{
private:
    short int age = 20;
public:
    long long int yearsOfCompetitiveProgrammingInCPP = 8;
    std::string collegeName = "UCSD";
    double collegeGPA = 4.0;

    std::vector<std::string> experiences =
        { "SWE Intern at TikTok", "NSF Undergraduate Researcher at UC Davis", "Research Intern at Stanford University" }
    std::vector<std::string> traits =
        { "AI/ML", "Data", "Information Retrieval", "Systems", "SIMD" };
    std::vector<std::string> hobbies =
        { "Community Organizer", "Competitive Programming", "US Squash"};
};
```

I got hooked on programming when I was 12 years old, in just a few weeks, C++ felt like my second language. I got to the top 20 in my grade nationally in USA Computing Olympiad and even surprised myself having placed 6th in the nation in Virginia Tech High School Programming Contest! I have been in competitive programming contests for the last 8 years, this year as team captain and coach for my college's ICPC team.

My passion for algorithms skyrocked after my happenchance **_conversation with the Professor Donald Knuth_** (at a Diwali party!) and has now morphed into delving (and going beyond) the depths of more CS/Math/EE fields from AI/ML & Data Mining to SIMD/AVX intrinsics-based acceleration for Molecular Computing.

- Real-time [sentiment classification using Google Cloud](https://github.com/Raj-Bapat/AI-Augmented-Mind) in my research on AI Augmented Mind 
- Hardware-accelerated [SIMD/AVX implementation of Smith Waterman](https://github.com/Raj-Bapat/SIMD-Smith-Waterman) DNA matching algorithm and test cases
- Hardware-accelerated [SIMD/AVX integrated into Nucliec Acid Designer](https://github.com/Raj-Bapat/SIMD-accelerated-Nucliec-Acid-Designer) open source tool
- A PostgreSQL [vector search RDBMS benchmark for performance and recall](https://github.com/Raj-Bapat/Analysis-and-Benchmark-for-Approx-Nearest-Neighbour-Search-in-SQL) analysis of SQL queries with Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search

# :sunglasses: A glimpse at two of my research papers
I love to go deep in a new field where we can contribute to furthering our understanding of a field or a method that helps accelerate the pursuit of future research. I am sharing two such areas, one in the intersection of bioinformatics and hardware accelerators, and the other in the area of Databases & Information Retrieval.

- _[A Benchmark and an Evaluation for SQL Queries with k-Nearest Neighbor Search](https://github.com/Raj-Bapat/Raj-Bapat/blob/main/RajBapat-VectorDatabase-paper.pdf)_, Raj Bapat

# :people_holding_hands: Engaging 1000s of students in two California communities
I am also passionate about building communities through programming competitions and programming clubs, having created two annual regional competitions that I founded in two communities (SF Bay Area and Davis). I am proud to have both competitions continuing to thrive, the high school competition had its 4th year and the university competition had its 2nd year.
- Co-founded the [first Davis community competitive programming contest](https://acpc-ucd.com/) in 2023 sponsored by UC Davis CS Department faculty under the guidance of Slobodan Mitrovi ÃÅc, Assistant Professor in CS. Now in its 2d year
- Co-founded the [first SF Bay Area community programming contest](https://bapc.gunncpc.com/archive) in 2021. I created this as a joint contest between two bay area high schools (Paly & Gunn) to engage students during the pandemic. Now in its 4th year
