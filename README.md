## Hi there üëã

# :postbox: About Me
My name is Raj Bapat, and I am a student and researcher at UCSD interested in AI, Systems and Databases!

    short int age = 20;

    long long int yearsOfCompetitiveProgrammingInCPP = 8;
    std::string collegeName = "UCSD";

I've been passionate about programming ever since I was 12 years old, when in just a few short weeks I coded the entire [game of life]([url](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/2001-02/cellular-automata/index.html)) from scratch, gaining proficiency C++ in the process. I've been riding that wave ever since, eventually reaching the top 20 in my grade nationally in USA Computing Olympiad, placing 6th nationally at the Virginia Tech High School Programming Contest! I've been competing in programming contests for the last 8 years including this year as an ICPC team captain and coach.

My broad interest in algorithms was elevated by a chance conversation I had with the legend himself **Professor Donald Knuth_** (at a Diwali party!), blossomed into multiple investigations across computing from AI/ML & Data Mining to SIMD/AVX intrinsics-based acceleration for Molecular Computing.

# :sunglasses: Take a glimpse at my research
I love to go deep in a new field where we can contribute to furthering our understanding of a field or a method that helps accelerate the pursuit of future research. I am sharing two such areas, one in the intersection of bioinformatics and hardware accelerators, and the other in the area of Databases & Information Retrieval.

I love exploring fields that push the boundaries of our understanding and accelerate future research. Recently, I‚Äôve been thinking about how to speed up bioinformatics algorithms with hardware acceleration, and diving deep into the world of Databases & Information Retrieval.

# :people_holding_hands: Join my California communities
Often my most personally fulfilling projects involve building communities through programming competitions and programming clubs. I co-founded two annual regional competitions in two communities (SF Bay Area and Davis). I am proud that both competitions continue to be cornerstones of thier respective regional programming communities, engaging 1000s of students yearly.
- Co-founded the [first Davis community competitive programming contest](https://acpc-ucd.com/) in 2023 sponsored by UC Davis CS Department faculty under the guidance of Slobodan Mitrovi ÃÅc, Assistant Professor in CS - now in its 2nd year
- Co-founded the [first SF Bay Area community programming contest](https://bapc.gunncpc.com/archive) in 2021. I created this as a joint contest between two bay area high schools (Paly & Gunn) to engage students during the pandemic - now in its 4th year
