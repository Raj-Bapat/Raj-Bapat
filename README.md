## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# :postbox: About Me
My name is Raj Bapat, I am a student and researcher at UCSD passionate about AI, Systems and Databases!

```cpp
class RajBapat
{
private:
    int age = 20;
public:
    int yearsOfCompetitiveProgrammingInCPP = 8;

    string collegeName = "UCSD";
    double collegeGPA  = 4.0;

    std::vector<std::string> experiences =
        { "SWE Intern at TikTok", "NSF Researcher at UC Davis", "Research Intern at Stanford University" }

    std::vector<std::string> traits =
        { "AI/ML", "Data", "Information Retrieval", "Systems", "SIMD" };

    std::vector<std::string> hobbies =
        { "Community Organizer", "Competitive Programming", "US Squash"};
};
```

I got hooked on programming when I was 12 years old, in just a few weeks C++ felt like my first language. In just a few years I got to the top 20 in my grade nationally in USA Computing Olympiad and even surprised myself having placed 6th in the nation in Virginia Tech High School Programming Contest! I have been pursuing competitive programming as a sport for the last 8 years, this year as team captain and coach for my college's ICPC team.

My passion for math and computer science started with algorithms (having skyrocked after my **happenstance conversation with _the_ Donald Knuth** at a Diwali party!) and has now morphed into a yearning to go deep into more CS/Math/EE fields from AI/ML and Data Mining to hardware acceleration using SIMD/AVX intrinsics for Molecular Computing.
